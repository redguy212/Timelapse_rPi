# Timelapse_rPi_Setup
Setup instructions code for Raspberry pi 

You need to choose the timelapse parameters.
open timelapseImageFinal.py in an editor and set:
  timeMinutes = [a] #set this to the number of minutes you wish to run your timelapse camera
  secondsInterval = [b] #number of seconds delay between each photo taken

**steps necessary for timelapse script to work on reboot/start**

Open startScript.sh
edit line 5 and change working directory from blank default to where your timelapse code is.
  EXAMPLE:
  from
  lxterminal --working-directory='[where youre code is saved]' --command='python3 timelapseImageFinal.py'
  to
  lxterminal --working-directory='/home/timelapse1/timelapse' --command='python3 timelapseImageFinal.py'

Change permissions for startScript.sh:
  In terminal: "chmod 755 [startScript path]"

Edit the Autostart file:
  In terminal: "sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart"
  add line "@lxterminal -e /home/pi/StartScript.sh"
    then press: CTRL + X, Y, Enter
